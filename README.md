# figureManager
This repository collects functions used to plot large data sets.

Therefore, decimation for various types is implemented and automatically handled by the FigureManager.
It automatically decimates the data set, if interaction takes place.

This toolbox is also mirrored to the [Matlab File Exchange](https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/71413-matlab-figuremanager).
It is heavily used in the [mdtsToolbox](https://github.com/RolandRitt/Matlab-mdtsToolbox).


## Dependencies
The test funcions use the graphics-toolbox: [https://github.com/RolandRitt/Matlab-graphics](https://github.com/RolandRitt/Matlab-graphics)
